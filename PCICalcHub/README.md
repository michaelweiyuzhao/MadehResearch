# PCI Predictor created at the University of Toronto Department of Civil Engineering

## Description

This web app is the result of a joint research project between Marmak Information Technologies and University of Toronto, with collaboration from Ontario Good Roads Association.
It is developed based on machine learning algorithms to estimates the PCI of asphalt roads in the short term. Models are developed after analysing the data of 1000 examples of road sections in the US and Canada.
Created in 2017 by Michael Zhao in collaboration with and based off the work of Madeh Piryonesi. Copied and hosted on Madeh's github at https://madeh.github.io and https://madeh.github.io/map/index.html

## Technology

This webapp is written in javascript with all computation done client-side. This is a very insecure, poorly-written, structured and planned-out website written when I was first starting to learn web development and did not want to go through the hassle nor had the resources to deploy a backend server to hide data and handle computation. I would not recommend anyone base their work off of this repo and I keep it here purely for reference.
